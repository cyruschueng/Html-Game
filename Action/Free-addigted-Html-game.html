 <p>Cupcake Fr...</p><div id="d">Indulge in the Cupcake Frenzy and become the most-loved bakery! Your goal in this game is to make the required cupcakes for the customers according to the orders. At each level, the customers will queue up and each of them will mention an order. You need to click the correct cupcake flavor on the left of the counter, then click to add any cream or toppings as required, and then click the customer to complete the order. The emoticon above a customer indicates the mood of the patron, and if you can complete the order quick enough, you will receive tips. If you take too long to make the cupcake, the customer will get angry and leave. Note that each of the ingredients has a certain cost, and if you have made a wrong cupcake, the customer will not take it and you need to throw the cupcake away by clicking the rubbish bin at the bottom right corner. At each level of the game you will need to earn a specific amount of money, as shown at the top of the screen. You need to fulfill the requirement before the timer at the top right corner runs out, or the game will end. As you advance in the game, some customers may order more than one cupcake, and you need to click the given tiered stand to place the cupcakes onto it before completing the order. Can you provide the best service and the tastiest cupcakes to your customers?</div>
