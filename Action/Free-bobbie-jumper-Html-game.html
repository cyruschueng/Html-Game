 <p>Snake Clas...</p><div id="d">The game of Snake is one of the most well-liked arcade classics in the world, and we have reproduced it with decent graphics, smooth control and addictive gameplay to further enhance your playing experience! Your goal in this game is to control the snake to consume the food and avoid hitting the walls, the obstacles or the snake itself. When the game starts, the snake will be moving in a horizontal direction, and you need to use the four arrow keys on your keyboard to control it, so that it can consume the food and grow. If the snake moves to the edge of the screen, it will appear from the opposite side. Starting with 5 lives, the snake will lose one life if it crashes into a wall, an obstacle or itself, and if all of the lives are gone, the game ends. Each level has a specific amount of food, as displayed at the bottom of the screen. When all of the food in the current level are consumed by the snake, you can proceed to the next level. The number of obstacles will increase as you advance in the game, therefore you must control the snake very carefully or it will be hurt!</div>

 <p>Vampire Fe...</p><div id="d">You're Viro, a ninja who stands against evil creatures! Yet you're a complex guy, instead of using conventional weapons, you spread a virus, which only affects demons and undeads.

Vampire Fever is a billiard-like physics game, which you control your character "Viro"(instead of the white ball) and try to infect by touching other creatures on the screen. The virus is very contagious among healthy, but it has one weakness: If two sick creature collide, they both heal.

As you progress, you encounter with different creatures(like vampires, mummies, ghosts, electrocuting demons, chocolate demons, etc...) and artifacts(barrels, bombs, slicers, trees, portals, etc...) which have different properties/physics behaviours, meaning lots of additional fun.

There are three modes included, normal game (with 120 levels), challenge mode(which include 6 levels and different gameplay mechanic) and a level creator.</div>
