<h4>Game Description:</h4> Have you been wandering around in the tedious days, trying hard to amuse yourself with some random playful shots, little Cupid? Finally it's time to do the lonely hearts a favor in Valentine's Day! In the park of romance, the bachelors and bachelorettes are roaming around, thinking about their desired partners. Your goal is to act as a go-between by pairing the lovers up and lead them to each other's embrace. When the game starts, you will be given 5 arrows as shown at the top of the screen. A number of male and female characters at the bottom, each has a desired person in mind. Click to shoot an arrow at a character to plant the seed of love, then fire at another to match the pair. If the characters are destined soulmates of each other, they will fall deeply in love and you will receive 500 points. But if the couple is a mismatch, no points will be awarded and you will lose arrows based on the number of discrepancy. For example, if one character desires another but not vice versa, 1 arrow will be deducted. If both of them are not into each other, you will lose 2 arrows. Complete the level by matching the required number of pairs as displayed at the top left corner, but note that only 10 seconds are allowed for each match. When the timer at the top of the screen counts down to zero, the pair of soulmates will be automatically matched and 2 arrows will be deducted. If all arrows are gone, you lose. The number of characters and required matches will gradually increase as you advance in the game, and some animals may appear randomly to distract you. If time allows, you may shoot and pair the animals up to receive a bonus arrow, but remember to avoid the terrible disaster of matching a human with an animal, or 1 arrow will be deducted. Mind your aim, bless the wandering hearts and light up their lives with the sweetest love!
