 <p>El's Quest...</p><div id="d">It looks like the game is called El's Quest, but it's actually called point collecting. Burn a circle trying to squash your attempt at triumph? Get points. Use your tri-beam to shoot a falling bomb? Get points. Catch a gem falling from the sky? Oh yeah you get points. Are you still alive as death approaches towards you from every corner at a gradually increasing pace? Yeah you're so accumulating points.

This game is very much made in the spirit of old Gameboy games, their lack of color, and beeps for music. But unlike those old games rather then telling your friends about your awesome score and them not believing you... we have leaderboards! Not only can you prove your score but show just how much better you are at a video game. Thats what really matters.</div>

 <p>Python...</p><div id="d">Cruelty to animals sucks. Especially cute, fluffy little rodents with limited or no awareness of impending danger. But not in the wild, for that is the way of nature. Besides, if mice are too dumb to move out of the way of a hungry snake chomping it's way through a whole bunch of their little buddies, then they really deserve what's coming to them! Guide your snake using your keypad around the ground, and eat up all those delicious little rat snacks! Be careful not to nibble your own tail or hit the wall, or you'll be reunited with your little friends in the great big desert in the sky!</div>
