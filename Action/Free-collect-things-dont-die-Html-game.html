(This is a truly absurd game that got less development time than it deserved -- but my one game a week deadline was looming, so here you have it -- I think it's probably still good for a chuckle and a few minutes of fun. It was also a first experiment with the Tublm engine, which has been a breeze to work with: http://tublm.org/)</div>
