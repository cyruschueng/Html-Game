<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
To win the game you should remove all the spheres inside the pentagon. To blow these spheres off  shoot at them with one of the spheres from its sides. You should first choose the sphere you want to shot with(a click on it will activate the sphere) and then click in the part of the board you want it to go. Don't be surprised if the sphere hasn't got where you meant it to - a sphere can slip only between two spheres of the next row.If a player manages to eliminate all the spheres of a certain color, his score will be doubled and two more rows of spheres will be added to the board. The color you have removed won't come to the board again. A certain number of attempts is given to allow a player to blow up as many spheres as possible. As soon as all the attempts are over one more row of spheres will be added to the board. Sometimes after a shot or a new row been added to the board some spheres can fall apart from the stock. They will disappear. You will get a bonus of 100 points for each sphere destroyed in such a way. Watching the Demo will help you to understand the rules of the game.
