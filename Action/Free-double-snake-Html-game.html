<h4>Game Description:</h4> One single snake may be a piece of cake for you, snake charmers - but is it still manageable when the number of snakes has doubled? In this game, your goal is to control the moving directions of the snakes, so that they can consume the food and keep growing without hitting the wall or themselves. Before the game starts, you will be given a list of options, allowing you to set the moving speed of the snakes as well as the number of snakes. You may increase the speed of the snakes by clicking the triangles at the upper part of the screen, or click the square buttons under the triangles to set the number of snakes. Then click the OK button at the bottom to confirm and start the game. You will then be given a walled square in which the snakes are moving horizontally. If you have only 1 snake, simply use the four arrow keys on your keyboard to control it. When 2 snakes are present, press W A S D to control the yellow one at the top, and use the four arrow keys to move the green snake at the bottom. Move the snakes around and consume the red balls in the area so that they can grow. Whenever a snake has consumed a red ball, it will grow longer by a square and you will receive 10 points. Then another red ball will appear in the area and you may continue the process. Your current score will be shown at the upper left corner. Remember to prevent the snakes from hitting anything, including themselves, or the game will end. Fully feed your snakes and save them from the catastrophes!
