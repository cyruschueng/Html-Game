 <p>Sky Hounds...</p><div id="d">This is a 2D, horizontal scrolling shoot'em up in the spirit of classic games such as R-type and Gradius. Play as a small, round mech, Dizzy, and his human co-pilot, Charley, in a search to find and rescue their friends after an alien invasion.

The Game features five areas all with completely distinct, parallax scrolling backgrounds and each with its own unique, multi-staged boss. It also features over a dozen unique enemies to destroy.

This is a dense game, and if it's not enough, unlock new game plus mode for an even greater challenge.

Farm money by playing or replaying levels, and buy a variety of weapons and equipment to ease your struggle. Also buy and deploy "pods" which are small floating entities that attack or provide utility.</div>

 <p>Mouse and ...</p><div id="d">After a long journey away from home, the little mouse is craving some tasty refreshments. It glows with delight when it sees bright yellow cubes of cheese along both sides of the river. However, it has to cross the rapid current in order to enjoy its treat. Your goal in the game is to help the little mouse to reach the other side of the river by jumping onto the boards which are floating in the water. You can click the little mouse at the lower left corner and move it onto a board in the water. Since the boards are floating in different directions, you need to move the little mouse to another board before it reaches the edge of the board, or it will fall into the water. A cat may appear on a board from time to time, and you must avoid it or the little mouse will be caught. Reach the cheese at the opposite bank, and you may start the next level. Beware of the rapid streams and the fast-moving boards as you advance in the game. Starting with 5 lives, the little mouse will lose one life if it has fallen into the water or when it is caught by the cat, and the game ends when all lives are gone. Avoid the obstacles and feed the little mouse until its stomach is full!</div>
