 <p>The Post O...</p><div id="d">The post office has been receiving numerous letters due to the coming Christmas. As an assistant in the office, you are given the task to collect the letters from the postal truck by using a mailbox. When the game opens, a delivery truck will pass the street and letters will be thrown. You need to move your mouse to control the position of the mailbox and collect the mails. Since the envelopes will be of different colors, you have to click the mailbox and change its color accordingly, so that the color of the mailbox and the target envelope is the same. Starting with 5 lives as indicated at the top left corner, one life will be deducted if you cannot catch a letter, or when the color of the mailbox and the envelope does not match. When all of the lives are gone, the game ends. Accomplish your task perfectly to get promoted!</div>

Now, When Bubble Girl is in Viper City she goes into more of that bubble shooting on various foes.

This is purposely made to be a SWF export, so this is abit more simple than the other bubble girl games. Please enjoy anyway!</div>
