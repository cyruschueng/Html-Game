 <p>Tank 2012...</p><div id="d">The battle of the tanks is on again! Is this the final exciting chapter? Will you survive?

Your objective is clear, destroy all who stand in your way, complete your missions, save the planet, make money, and be number 1!

Shop

Unlike previous versions, the upgrade shop works differently - you have to try your luck to get weapons and other defenses on the wheel of fortune!

The more you spin, the more expensive it gets! 

Backpacks

You also have three backpacks to load up with different weapons and defenses.

Each backpack allows you to take in 1 primary weapon, 1 secondary weapon and 1 special.

You also have 3 'automatic' devices that can be used to aid with your campaign.

Tanks

You have a selection of different tanks that can be used during your missions. Each has advantages and disadvantages - you decide which tank is best to use.</div>
