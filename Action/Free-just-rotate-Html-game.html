 <p>Ice & fire...</p><div id="d">This is Ice & fire an entry for the stencyljam 2013. It's a platforms game with infinite jump and a jump down function. The program of this game may seem simple but it's actually complex, for example the jump is not a regular jump it's measured so you can jump as high as you keep the button press, you press it more you jump higher I think that the first game in that this was shown was the mythical Mario  Bros for Nintendo.

Also in the game you can see a girl but this is not a regular sprite, it's actually a marionette, her hands, head, neck, torso, legs, etc are controlled individually, the forearms move according to the position, angle and length of the arms and they also turn according to their own angle, this to attain more fluid movement.</div>
