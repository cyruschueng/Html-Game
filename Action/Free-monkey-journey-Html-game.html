 <p>Zombies: R...</p><div id="d">Zombies: Run or Kill, a new zombie shooter game is here! Zombies attack you! UNDEAD has occupied our village. Get your weapons, go into actions, cause ZOMBIES MUST DIE!

Android version available here: https://play.tublm.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zombieshootergame.zombierunorkill

Our village was full of peace and tranquility until a zombie invasion happened. The living dead can nowadays be seen all over the place. There is only one zombie survivor left, and that is you. You as a special agent have a very responsible task - to try to find other survivors and to kill the zombies. Kill'em all! DO NOT tell yourself something like "Zombies, RUN", but instead encourage yourself to become THE zombie killer.
This is one zombie free game which will make your life more interesting. Once you start playing this cool game, you won't be able to stop. And it ain't easy game at all! You'll have to be smart in order to kill enemies who are completely brainwashed. There are different types of zombies in this game, some of which are easier to kill while others need multi-kills or direct headshots.
You have different weapons at your disposal, from which you can choose the one that fits you best when evil zombie attacks you. The standard one is sword, but there is also a special lightsaber to help you destroy zombie hordes. The more zombies you kill, the more experience you get, and in that way you get more bullets for gun and rifle. As far as laser cannon and chainsaw are concerned, use them carefully - you cannot use them whenever you want, and as the game progresses you will need more powerful weapons. We wanted to make this shooting game as interesting as possible, so you will have to fulfill different missions all the time. With each fulfilled mission, you'll get three more missions but they'll be more challenging and exciting. In every moment, you'll have 3 missions to complete (with every mission you'll get more XP). Download free game right now!
Another awesome feature of this game is that you can kill zombies either by day or night. This changes in accordance with the time set on your phone. From 9pm to 5 am it is night and it's fully dark and zombies are more active then, and from 5am you can feel safer because you are in the day light. This is why this is the best game for android! It can be a game for kids, but also for adults.
Bear in mind that these are some whacked inhuman, and that you'll need both your hands to defeat them. The more you play, the better you'll be, until one day you become a true zombie terminator!
You will be under attack all the time and you'll have to fight back! Be wise, keep your health and fight against the zombie apocalypse.
