 <p>Multiplaye...</p><div id="d">Enjoy your favorite winter activity online, make impeccable strikes and cover your opponent with snow from head to toe! Your goal in this game is to throw snowballs at your opponent until he is defeated. When the game starts, each player will be assigned a monster, and they will appear on the left and right side of the screen. A windmill will be located in the middle, indicating the wind direction with an arrow and the wind speed with a propeller. To decide the order of throw in the duel, you and your opponent will first need to throw a snowball to the highlighted area that appears in the middle of the screen. During your turn, an arrow-shaped pointer will appear, and you can click to set the throwing angle, then click again to set the power. After both players have thrown a snowball, the one who gets nearer to the highlighted area can start to throw snowballs at his opponent. Since the wind direction and speed will change constantly in the duel, you will need to consider the environment or your throw will miss. The game then continues until a monster has been hit 3 times and loses. Can you come down the stage clean and victorious?</div>
