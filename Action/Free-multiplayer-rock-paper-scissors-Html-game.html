 <p>Sandwich S...</p><div id="d">Launching your first sandwich shop, you aim to offer your customers the best food and service in town. When the game starts, a customer will arrive at your shop and order a sandwich. You need to click and drag the appropriate ingredients onto the order area in the middle, starting from the bottom of the sandwich. Be careful when you pick the ingredients as each piece of them costs money, and a sandwich with wrong ingredients will be rejected. Also note that hams and eggs have to be cooked before they can be put onto the sandwich. To do so, click and drag the raw food onto the pan at the bottom right corner, then wait until the food is ready, as indicated by a circle. Click and drag the sandwich to the customer after you have finished preparing to receive the money. An emoticon will appear on top of each customer, reflecting the level of satisfaction. If the customer is satisfied with the efficiency of your service, you can receive extra tips. Each level has a target amount of income as shown at the top of the screen, while the clock at the top right corner will display the remaining time of the current level. If you cannot earn the required amount of money before the time runs out, you lose. Develop your prestige to become the customers' favorite sandwich shop!</div>
