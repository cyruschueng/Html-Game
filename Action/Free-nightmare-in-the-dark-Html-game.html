at a very small village in a remote region.

He lived a quiet, solitary life in a coner
of the cemetery, for he hept away from
village people due to 
his very ugly appearance.

One day he found the graves were ransacked
and some corpses were stolen.

he decided to eliminate the grave burglars
by himself.

But now he must escape from the Crypts of Na'uta before they are consumed in a fiery sea of destruction. Drained from his battle with the Zombie Lord, Father O'Malley must struggle to the surface with his last ounces of strength. (This is a truly absurd game that got less development time than it deserved -- but my one game a week deadline was looming, so here you have it -- I think it's probably still good for a chuckle and a few minutes of fun. It was also a first experiment with the Tublm engine, which has been a breeze to work with: http://tublm.org/)</div>
