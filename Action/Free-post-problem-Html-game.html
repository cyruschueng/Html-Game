 <p>Snowman Sk...</p><div id="d">Humans apply cosmetics to become more beautiful, and snowmen also need distinct features to stand out in the crowd. Come and help Mr. Snowman to ski along the slope and pick up the necessary components! When the game starts, a skied snowman with a blank face will start to travel down the slope. Use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snowman, then pick up 2 pinecones, 1 carrot and 2 branches to complete the task. The time you have spent is recorded at the top right corner, and the faster you finish, the higher your score. Then you can start the next level by picking up a new snowball on the slope. Remember not to crash into the trees as the components and a layer of snow on the snowman will fall off. Multiple hits will decrease the size of the snowman, and when the snowman is completely destroyed, the game ends. Give the snowman a dazzling look to celebrate season!</div>

 <p>Planet War...</p><div id="d">Planet Wars is an exciting old-school top down alien shooter with completely customizable weapons.

Simple controls make the game easy to pick up and play.

Play through the 10 mission campaign, with beautifully illustrated graphic novel style story panels. Missions range from offence to defence missions- upon which you can build a base to stop the alien horde.

There is also a survival mode with 6 maps, where you destroy wave after wave of incoming aliens.

Earn in-game money with every battle you fight, or every achievement you earn. You can spend on upgrading your weapons by buying different components. There are 7 different upgradable parts, this means you can completely customize your gun and armour to suit your style of play.

There are over 70 different items and components in the game with which to do this; including 17 core weapons which range from standard rifles to flame-throwers and rocket launchers: Make a fast firing sniper rifle with exploding rounds, or a deadly powerful shotgun with a bayonet for close encounters!</div>
