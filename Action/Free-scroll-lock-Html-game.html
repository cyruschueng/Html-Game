<h4>Game Description:</h4> Scroll Lock. Who would have guessed that the once most useless piece of plastic in your keyboard would be a TRUE SAVIOR OF STICKMEN!?

This game was created to grant the wish of many users that felt bad for the forever alone Scroll Lock key.

<h4>Play Instructions:</h4>
Press Scroll Lock to lock the scrolling. That's it!
Oh, and avoid the crushing spikes. AND the deadly laser on your tail!

Technical:
M - Mutes

Note: if your "Scroll Lock" key has suffered from atrophy due to lack of use (or your Apple keyboard has already condemned it to oblivion), spacebar does the job too - but you'll miss half the fun!
