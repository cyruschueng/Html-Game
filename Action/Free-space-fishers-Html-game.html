 <p>Squares...</p><div id="d">Be prepared to indulge in the exciting game of Squares! Your aim in this game is to rotate the objects until 4 of the same kind form the four corners of a square, so that those objects can be removed. You will be given a 4x4 square with various types of objects evenly distributed on the spots. When you move your mouse to an object, a square will frame its three adjacent objects, indicating that these four objects will be rotated together. Click to rotate the objects and arrange 4 identical objects into four corners of a square, and the objects will be destroyed. The squares formed by the objects can be of any sizes and orientations; a larger square will give a higher score. You will first start by rotating in counterclockwise direction, but you may change it by pressing the Spacebar on your keyboard or by clicking the arrow buttons at the bottom of the play area. The bar on top of the square indicates the remaining time, and when it reaches its end on the left, the game ends. Extra time will be awarded when objects are successfully removed, so form more combos to extend the fun!</div>

 <p>Spectral S...</p><div id="d">Take control of Spectral Serpent in this polychromatic twist on a retro classic! Spectral Serpent is hungry, and has to eat to grow longer and extend his lifespan, but he often mistakes his own tail for a tasty snack!

 <p>The Brim...</p><div id="d">Everybody knows that imps like to live on the edge. 

Thus, our brave little lesser demon finds itself literally at the brim of hell, where it must survive as long as it possibly can. For points (hell creatures are notorious for being totally into arcade-style gameplay) and possibly the admiration of harpies.

Basically just jump from platform to platform, try to stay away from the edges, avoid the spiked platforms and buzzsawballs, and that's it! The longer you stay alive the higher your score.</div>
