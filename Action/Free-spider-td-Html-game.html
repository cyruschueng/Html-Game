<h4>Game Description:</h4> Spider TD is a mix of tower defense and arcade styles. The main idea behind the creation of this game was to make a tower defense game more dynamic, thrilling, and refreshing. It looks like these goals have been successfully implemented in the Spider TD. 
The rules are easy to understand and fast to learn. It will take you less than five min to master how to build defense, use magic skills, and move your attack forces to where they are needed at most to stop the hordes of monsters. 
Being an action game, the Spider TD will keep you in tension every second and every new challenge will add even more excitement.

Spider TD also utilizes role playing elements such as characters and characters leveling with ability to choose different skills on each level. On the one hand, it makes the game less predictable with unlimited variations. On the other hand, you can choose the path that suits you the most. 
The role playing elements definitely make the Spider TD more exciting game and we hope that you will enjoy playing it.

In the Spider TD you can choose up to three characters (Fire Mage, Ice Mage, Arbalester). Spider TD contains more than 20 types of monsters, spread across 50 levels.
