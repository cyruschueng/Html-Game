<h4>Game Description:</h4> Be prepared to indulge in the exciting game of Squares! Your aim in this game is to rotate the objects until 4 of the same kind form the four corners of a square, so that those objects can be removed. You will be given a 4x4 square with various types of objects evenly distributed on the spots. When you move your mouse to an object, a square will frame its three adjacent objects, indicating that these four objects will be rotated together. Click to rotate the objects and arrange 4 identical objects into four corners of a square, and the objects will be destroyed. The squares formed by the objects can be of any sizes and orientations; a larger square will give a higher score. You will first start by rotating in counterclockwise direction, but you may change it by pressing the Spacebar on your keyboard or by clicking the arrow buttons at the bottom of the play area. The bar on top of the square indicates the remaining time, and when it reaches its end on the left, the game ends. Extra time will be awarded when objects are successfully removed, so form more combos to extend the fun!

 <p>Battle Rin...</p><div id="d">Race against three opponents and be the one who stands right next to the target! In this game, your goal is to control the red ring so that it gets closest to the center of the play area. Before each round starts, 4 rings of red, yellow, blue and white colors will stay at the four corners of the play area. You will be given 10 seconds to modify the settings of the red ring. Move your mouse to change the shooting direction, and hover the mouse over the arrow-shaped gauge to adjust the power. When the preparation time is up, all of the rings will be released simultaneously and compete for the nearest spot to the center. If a ring bumps into its rivals, it will be bounced away. When all rings are settled, each of the ring's distance to the center will be shown, and you can receive points based on the result of the red ring. The game continues until all 5 rounds are completed. Can you beat your competitors in each and every round? Step into the fiery battle rings now!</div>
