In the game of Montris, your goal is to rotate the groups of blocks so that they fill the rows in the play area and then be destroyed. When the game starts, a group of blocks will descend from the top of the play area, and the next group will be displayed at the top left corner of the play area for your reference. You can press the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to move the group of blocks, the up arrow key or X key to rotate the block in clockwise direction, the Z key for counterclockwise rotation, and the down arrow key to drop the block. When the groups of blocks fill a complete row, they will be removed from the play area. Each level has a specific number of rows to be filled, as shown on the right of the screen. You need to fulfill the requirement in order to proceed. If the blocks pile up and reach the top of the play area, the game ends. Charge into the electrifying cascades for unlimited excitement!</div>
